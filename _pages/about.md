I am a PhD candidate in Biology at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), with an interdisciplinary background in structural biology, biochemistry, and computational biology. I am expected to receive my PhD degree in June 2026.

My doctoral research focuses on elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of protein–lipid interactions, particularly in the lipid-binding specificity. During the first part of my PhD, I investigated the structure and regulation of key membrane enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism, combining biochemical assays, structural analysis, and functional studies. This work led to publications in *Cell Reports* (co-first author), *Nature Communications*, *Science Advances*, and *The EMBO Journal*.

In parallel, I have developed a strong interest in AI-driven approaches for protein science. In the later stage of my PhD, I worked on sequence-based protein representation learning and multi-label classification, integrating deep learning models with biological interpretation. I developed PLiCat (Protein-Lipid interaction Categorization tool), the first sequence-based model to predict lipid-binding preference of the given protein using sequence as the only input.

My goal is to bridge experimental structural biology with machine learning methods to better understand and design functional biomolecular systems. My long-term career goal is to establish an independent, interdisciplinary research program that seamlessly connects computation and experiment.
